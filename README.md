# hello-world
General and miscellaneous bits n pieces
Here mainly to learn, to catch up, having a resonably solid foundation in BASIC (both the Visual version [in early Windows/Excel] and its predecessor [on an Amstrad CPC464!]). I've picked up a few scraps since then but feel a little overwhelmed with all the coding (or programming as it was in 'my' day!) options that seem to be available. In fact this very plethora of languages and platforms seems to me a little ironic, given that back in the day, when networking was new, the general push appeared to be towards standardisation!

Of course I realise that today's machines are a far cry from the 64k world of yesteryear, not just in power, speed and capability, but also in functionality - and it's this very diverse functionality that demands the use of differing tools of construction (possibly) - I just thought it was a tad ironic - like how we were assured that future computing technology would automate (and simplify! - yes, really, that's what they said!) so many of our menial tasks and day-to-day drudgery that we'd all have much more 'spare time' on our hands!

I'm rambling. I'll stop now.
